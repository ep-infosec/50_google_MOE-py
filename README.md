## MOE-py

A system for synchronizing repositories

### Installation

Please see the wiki pages for installation and setup instructions.

### Project status

This is the project originally hosted at http://code.google.com/p/make-open-easy, written
in python, to synchronize private and open-source repositories.  It is not under active
development, though many stil find it useful

A related java-basedtool is under active (resumed) development at 
<http://github.com/google/MOE>, which does not require an active server, but uses
JSON files to store migrations and equivalencies.

The python-based scrubber infrastructure is used by some installations of java-moe.
